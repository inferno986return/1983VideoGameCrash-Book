Foreword

\begin_layout Standard
This article was written back in 2013 for an assignment for my first (and
 only) year of Computer Science at the University of Derby.
 The assignment asked that the article be 2-3 pages long and stringently
 follow the IEEE document standard.

As someone who can't stand Times New Roman (particularly at point size 12),
 I was never quite satisfied with what I submitted even when I was happy
 with the content I had written and the images I had found and provided.

\begin_layout Standard
So I have finally put this article where I believe it belongs; in a LyX
 document with attractive typesetting in a presentable serif typeface (Charis
 SIL) using knowledge I have gained afterward from book typesetting and
 eBook production.

I also wanted to fix up some grammatical mistakes, re-check the reference

 So with that in mind I do consider this updated version of the article
 to be the superior version.

Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The year is 2013, video games are commonplace and the industry as a whole
 seems to be prospering well (Gartner, 2013).
 It was not always smooth sailing and for a short while the entire games
 industry's future was put into question, after a 97% drop in market value
 in 1983 during the Atari era in the United States (CleverNoobs, 2013, 0:0:20;
 Electronic Games Magazine, 1985, pp.
 30-31).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*

The Great Video Game Crash of 1983
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The name of this huge dent on the industry was The Great Video Game Crash
 of 1983.
 The name is used to describe the events that brought the market value down
 to such a low level.
 It was caused by multiple factors, which can almost be completely attributed
 to the Atari 2600's openness because anyone could make cartridges for the
 console.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first step towards the crash happened in 1979 when a handful of disgruntled
 games developers working for Atari were unhappy that they were not credited
 for each game's development and that they did not receive royalties for
 each copy sold.
 Since Atari refused to alter their policy to fit the games developers'
 demands, they left the company to form the World's first 3
\begin_inset script superscript

\begin_layout Plain Layout
rd
\end_layout

\end_inset

 party publisher, Activision (Activision, n.d.).
 This first step meant that not only did Atari lose talent but they gained
 competition.
 The console's openness meant that Activision could make and sell cartridges
 for the Atari 2600 without paying any license or royalties back to Atari.
 This was not helpful to Atari at all and foreshadowed what was yet to come.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The second step was that Atari released some poor 1
\begin_inset script superscript

\begin_layout Plain Layout
st
\end_layout

\end_inset

 party licensed titles for the 2600, both Pac-Man and E.T.
 the Extra-Terrestrial (E.T.) which were released in 1982.
 They were highly anticipated but badly received by critics and fans because
 they were full of bugs and glitches and not particularly fun to play.
 This was not helped by the fact they were both were rushed to completion
 and lacked quality assurance by Atari.
 Atari had spent a great deal of money in licensing fees for rights to E.T.
 and Pac-Man, and they got little financial gain from it when their customers
 realised that these games were not worth the investment (Giant Bomb, E.T.)
 (IGN, Top 10 Best-Selling Atari 2600 Games).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The third step was that many other companies were wanting to the ride the
 video game money train.
 Back in the 1980's, video games were the fastest growing industry in all
 the USA.
 Many companies including Quaker, Purina and Mystique all made atrocious
 games to capitalise on huge market.
 Though this effect pushed it down even further (CleverNoobs, 2013).
 With games like Chase the Chuck Wagon, Name this Game and, all created
 by these companies purely for profit over entertainment value.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The fourth step was that at the same as the Atari 2600 era was the birth
 of the affordable personal computer which could allow the consumer to both
 play games and be productive.
 Further adding competition to Atari's business because there were other
 machines on the market that could do multiple things for your money (CleverNoob
s, 2013, 0.2.0).
 With all these terrible games out there and competition from the personal
 computer space, most consumers simply got tired and angry playing with
 console games.
 So enough consumers voted with their wallets and decided not to buy them.
 This caused the market to topple over and caused the 97% drop from $3.2
 billion (~

Recovery of the Console
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The market was almost down and out, consumers were immensely cynical of
 the words “video game”.
 If it was not for Nintendo, through some clever marketing tactics with
 the advertising of Robotic Operating Buddy (R.O.B), a peripheral for their
 upcoming Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) console the console gaming
 industry might not have ever been resuscitated back to its former glory.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The NES managed to bring the industry back on track, with Nintendo learning
 from Atari's mistakes in the past.
 Nintendo saw that 3rd-party development for their console could be beneficial
 to their business, but it should be controlled with licensing (an agreement
 between the publisher and the console manufacturer) to ensure both quality
 control and enable Nintendo to profit off the games' sales.
 There were many successful 3
\begin_inset script superscript

\begin_layout Plain Layout
rd
\end_layout

\end_inset

 party titles including Tetris (1989), Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1989)
 and Punch-Out!! (1987).
 Nintendo did not rest on their laurels with just 3
\begin_inset script superscript

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\end_inset

 party content and began to release games of their own much like Atari did.
 Many of these games were the first entry to many loved franchises including
 Super Mario Bros.
 in 1985 (which itself was the bestselling NES game of all-time), Legend
 of Zelda (1986) and Metroid (1986).
 These were all well received by the audience and, subsequently, have received
 many sequels to this day.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since the NES console was locked down due to Nintendo learning from Atari's
 main mistake of allowing oversaturation of content, games that were not
 approved by Nintendo would be released unofficially as cartridges but would
 never receive the sales figures or critical attention that most official
 content would receive (IGN, n.d.).
 This included games that were not even submitted to Nintendo to approve
 because of content, a reluctance to pay licensing fees and a disagreement
 over licensing conditions.
 The unofficial cartridges would often look physically different to official
 cartridges and used techniques to bypass the 10NES authorisation chip that
 were present in official cartridges to ensure only official cartridges
 could be played (Horton K., n.d.).
 In fact, Atari under a subsidiary called Tengen, actually made unofficial
 cartridges for the NES as well as having their games officially released
 on the console under the Atari name (Oxford, 2005).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The console continued selling until the NES's successor Super Nintendo Entertain
ment System (SNES) arrived in the early 90's as the direct successor to
 the NES.
 While it sold less units than the original NES, it retained dominance over
 competition from Sega with their MegaDrive (Genesis in the USA) and other
 consoles.
 The console itself had full 16-bit capabilities bringing improved graphical
 and sound capabilities with it (Buchanan, 2009).
 Subsequent consoles would also be locked down and the consumer would be
 prevented from playing unofficial 3

 party content and using unofficial 3rd party accessories by the manufacturers,
 because it was a system that was proven to work for the console manufacturers
 (Chacksfield, 2010).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Whilst there were a few hobby consoles that were open to modification by
 the manufacturer, such as, the Pandora console by OpenPandora, and the
 Dingoo A320 by Dingoo Technology Ltd, none of these consoles took the Internet
 by storm like the OUYA did.
 The OUYA, which is a $99 (

5,346,069) in funding with 63,416 backers via the crowdfunding platform
 Kickstarter in 2012 (Kickstarter, 2012).
 This suggests that customers had a great deal of faith in the concept of
 an open console.
 Furthermore the OUYA has recently celebrated its 500th game, that is, Neon
 Shadow (Tasty Poison Games, 2013).
 The OUYA is built on the foundation of being an open system where every
 game is free to try out with games available to purchase via digital distributi
on.
 In September 2013 Valve formally announced the Steam Machine, which is
 an open console backed by them which allows modification in a similar fashion
 to that of an ordinary gaming PC (Valve, 2013).
 The fact that Valve has invested in custom hardware for the Steam Machine
 itself, the controller and the operating system, implies that they have
 confidence in making profit from an open console.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is most likely due to the extreme popularity of their digital distribution
 Steam.
 Steam (and most other digital distributors) solved Atari's issue back in
 the early 1980's, by managing quality control via a number of methods.
 For example, Steam Greenlight allows the opportunity for potential customers
 to vote for a game before it is allowed to be sold on the storefront.
