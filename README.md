# How People Are Entertained: The Consequences of the 1983 Great Video Game Crash
## 2nd Edition (Improved grammar, checked sources and general fixes)

## Overview:

This is an article I wrote up on the North American 1983 Video Game Crash and the death + revival of open consoles (game consoles that formally allow/encourage homebrew and modification).

I have typeset it in LaTeX using LyX to make it look presentable on both print and screen. Currently I am happy enough with this document in its current state, but I may add/modify a few things.

## E-book:

I have provided an ePub and the code needed to recreate it, feel free to use the code for your own projects as per the licenses stated below. Currently the ePub passes [epubcheck 4.0.2](https://github.com/IDPF/epubcheck) with `No errors or warnings detected.`
