# How People Are Entertained: The Consequences of the 1983 Great Video Game Crash

## 2nd Edition (Improved grammar, checked sources and general fixes)

This is an article I wrote up on the North American 1983 Video Game Crash and the death + revival of open consoles (game consoles that formally allow/encourage homebrew and modification). 

I have typeset it in LaTeX using LyX to make it look presentable on both print and screen. Currently I am happy enough with this document in its current state, but I may add/modify a few things.
