## Overview:

This is an article I wrote up on the North American 1983 Video Game Crash and the death + revival of open consoles (game consoles that formally allow/encourage homebrew and modification).

I have typeset it in LaTeX originally using LyX (now I use [ShareLaTeX](https://www.sharelatex.com/)) to make it look presentable on both print and screen. Currently I am happy enough with this document in its current state, but I may add/modify a few things.

## E-book:

I have provided an ePub and the code needed to recreate it, feel free to use the code for your own projects as per the licenses stated below. Currently the ePub passes [epubcheck 4.0.2](https://github.com/IDPF/epubcheck) with `No errors or warnings detected.`

### Compiling:

A new ePub file can be made by using the provided `CreateE-book.py` via installing [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and then running the script on IDLE, [Thonny](http://thonny.org/) or the `python3 CreateE-book.py` command on the macOS/GNU-Linux Terminal. The script however **does not** work with Python 2 and I have no plans to backport.

XHTML, CSS and the `metadata.json` files can be edited using a text editor such as [Atom](https://atom.io/) and [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/).

The `toc.ncx` and `content.opf` are generated by the `CreateE-book.py` and shouldn't be edited as they would be overwritten.
